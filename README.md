### Extract web search engine data and save it to a database ###

![Alt text](http://173.0.133.251/images/GitHub/webDataExtImg.jpg "Web data extraction")


Web data extraction when performed manually, is a time consuming, and error-prone process. Furthermore, maintenance of any manual based approach is very expensive and not scalable.

Automating data gathering and analysis is crucial for enterprises to retain or gain a competitive edge. 



### INTELLIGENT APPLICATION ###

<ol>
<li>Monitor websites for any new product listings and extract data.</li>
<li>Financial analysts monitor trends and stats for products.</li>
<li>Save search engine results into a database instead of HTML or web file.</li>
<li>Extract property information from websites.</li>
<li>Monitor blogs and forums.</li>
<li>Compare interest rates from various sources.</li>
<li>Harvest contacts and addresses.</li>
<li>Lead generation.</li>
<li>Monitor customer opinions about you and competitors.</li>
<li>Run multiple web data extraction tasks simultaneously at once.</li>
<li>Gain or retain a competitive edge.</li>

### BUSINESS RISK / CONSIDERATIONS ###

Flash animation is a great way to present complex content because it allows the designer to put more content in a finite space, without wrecking page design. For technology sites, Flash is an ideal way to present a slide show or movie explaining a complex product.

At the other end of the spectrum, a site built entirely with Flash suffers a great disadvantage because it lacks page structure to organize the content, internal linking, and unique page titles.  And Flash gets a bad rap, undeserved in my opinion, for harming search engine visibility.

However, worry no more as this web data extraction function works with any website made of:

<ol>
<li>Flash</li>
<li>I-frames</li>
<li>AJAX</li>
<li>Sites with and without frames</li>
<li>Secure sites and non-secure sites</li>
<li>Sites with JavaScript</li>
<li>Static and dynamic web sites</li>
<li>Forums and blogs</li>
<li>...and much more</li>
</ol>



### TESTING APPROACH ###

A.  Go to any website to extract data from e.g. http://businessfinder.mlive.com/

B.  Type "Audit" as the search keyword.

C.  Data extracted from the search results which may span multiple pages i.e. it can go to the next page until the last page automatically.

D.  Results of the extraction.

E.  Saved results in "Audit_Firms_Michigan.csv" file.

F.  Modifications to the scripts may be made easily.

### THIRD-PARTY REQUIREMENTS ###

1.  The web data extraction process rely on an external application called Automation Anywhere (http://http://www.automationanywhere.com).  The easiest way to install Automation Anywhere on a Windows computer is to download the software from http://http://www.automationanywhere.com/download/freeTrial.htm.

2.  Copy both script files into the folder: "My Documents\Automation Anywhere\Automation Anywhere\My Tasks".  For example: "C:\Users\Photoshop\Documents\Automation Anywhere Files\Automation Anywhere\My Tasks"

A)  Data_Harvesting.atmx
 
B)  Data_Harvesting.atmr

You will be able to see the saved script in the Automation Anywhere's task pane.  Now you can run the ACL script to call the script in Automation Anywhere to perform the web data extraction.

<blockquote>Automation Anywhere scripting is easy to learn and can the learning curve of the person from programming background such as VB, C, C++, java, .Net, etc. will be much smaller and can trained faster.</blockquote>
