### THIRD-PARTY REQUIREMENTS ###

1.  The web data extraction process rely on an external application called Automation Anywhere (http://http://www.automationanywhere.com).  The easiest way to install Automation Anywhere on a Windows computer is to download the software from http://http://www.automationanywhere.com/download/freeTrial.htm.

2.  Copy both files into the folder: "My Documents\Automation Anywhere\Automation Anywhere\My Tasks".  For example: "C:\Users\Photoshop\Documents\Automation Anywhere Files\Automation Anywhere\My Tasks"

A)  Data_Harvesting.atmx
 
B)  Data_Harvesting.atmr

3.  The software would be able to detect the presence of the saved task.  Now you can select the task and run it.
